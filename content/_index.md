> The happiest of all lives is a busy solitude 

Welcome to the digital complilation of my fight against entropy, colloquially known as a website.

This serves as a listing of various projects I've worked on, and hopefully serves as self-manipulation to force lock-in on those I care about. You'll also find cacophony of pages dedicated to incoherent ramblings and half-baked thoughts. That's the blog section. 

There's also an About page if that's your thing.
