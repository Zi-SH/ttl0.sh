Originally written explicitly for Windows, a Linux-native client was announced under the codename "XLCore". 

My contributions were mostly simple code that implemented support for DXVK ASYNC, ESync, FSync and Feral GameMode. I also provided testing and feedback as I was intimately familiar with Linux and playing the game through Lutris at the time.
