**STATUS:** `Maintained`

Rosetta (and its partner Genki) serve as a visual novel playthrough bot in several Discord servers for the Science Adventure series.

Genki and Rosetta were written by another person who offered to write a nicer version of another bot I had written, named DaSH. 

DaSH offered users command-based functions that would allow them to open channels to post thoughts as they played through a visual novel. It operated as a sort of self-controlled Let's Play Discord channel dedicated to one person.

Due to the age of the DaSH bot a rewrite was desperately needed. A volunteer offered to make one with channel archive capabilities to help with the limit discord channel capacity as well as a django backend for administrative functions. This person has since moved on from the community but I maintain and host the bot.
