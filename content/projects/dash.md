This projects consisted of a complete rewrite of an existing bot's functionality, as the owner of the bot had abandoned the project but several communities still relied on it. 

The bot provided commands to allow users to create a personal discord Text channel, which would be open to people who had already finished the game. The user could post as they played through the game, sharing reactions and speculations as they progressed. Commands provided users the ability to assign themselves "Chapter" roles so others could see where they were in the game. Upon completion, player were able to close the channel and receive a role showing they completed the game.
