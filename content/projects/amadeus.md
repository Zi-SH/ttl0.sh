This project consisted of a large rewrite of an existing bot that had fallen into disrepair. It offered markov-chain generation that pulled from a text file of the server's previous postings. It also provided admins with tools like muting which didn't exist on Discord at the time.

Amadeus was abandoned due for a few reasons:
- Very much not GDPR-friendly
- Lots of inappropriate content, both in the source and generated
- Bot had `@everyone` permissions which was always funny to witness but never fun to clean
